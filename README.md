# Salary-Prediction-App
Predict salaries with accuracy using machine learning algorithms.

This repository contains a salary prediction application built using Python, leveraging machine learning algorithms to provide accurate salary predictions.

Key Features

- Machine learning models for salary prediction (Linear Regression)
- Data visualization for salary distribution and trends
- Model evaluation and comparison

Repository Contents

- app/: Salary prediction application code
- data/: Salary dataset (CSV)
- models/: Trained machine learning models
  
Future Work

- Incorporate additional features (e.g., location, industry)
- Develop more advanced machine learning models
- Expand dataset to include more diverse populations

Also, consider adding sections like:

- Data Dictionary: Describe the variables and features in the dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Provide detailed evaluation metrics for the model.
- References: List sources used in the analysis.
- Screenshots: Include screenshots of visualizations and code.
